Making a webpage design

This website is my first official website that I make from the ground.

It supposed to be as close as the website provided from this link:
"https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png
using the preset that's already been given:
"https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png"

Things that I need to improve and add to the code: 
1. the usages of flex: 1 {flex grow, flex shrink, and flex basis}
2. the usages of flex wrap
3. the usages of align-self
4. the usages more of the display
5. making the website shrink without breaking/overflow the website content
